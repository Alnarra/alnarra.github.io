<h1>Merry Chrimbus!</h1> 
<p>Forgive me, I was feeling lazy, and this note is going out to quite a few people :3c, Chrimbus cat has decided that it's time to make some Christmas rounds and spread some Christmas cheer! So I wanted to wish you and yours a merry Christmas! I know that this year has been the definition of a rough time and so I wanted to offer what help I can to try and make things just a little better.</p>
<p>Usually I stick to the simple things like getting gifts off amazon, but this year be it a combination of the last few weeks being crazy and the somewhat depressing side effects of 2020, it seemed that this gift was far more approrpiate. Part of our mission statement with TVA is to assist the people of the valley, and you are my people. My mom made a joke about investing, but honestly the best investment that I could make was in all of you</p> 
<p>You are the friends who have seen me through impossible times, the family that has made sure I'm alive and well, and so there's really nothing I felt like encompassed a good enough response to that, so I am hoping this helps in a rough time!</p> 
<p>With Much Love</p> 
<p>The Chrimbus Cat!</p>
