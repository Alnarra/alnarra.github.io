            <p>Hi everyone! As I'm sure you're all very well aware, I am in fact pretty garbage at picking out gifts. Or, rather, by the time I get my act together usually it's well into august of the next year. So I'm reaching into my hat and pulling out my same bag of tricks! But that isn't to say I don't want to send along a message.</p>
            <p>This year like those before it has been filled with all sorts of new and crazy sorts of things and places. And as with all the years past, those sorts of things wouldn't have been possible without each and every one of you. You guys are my reason to keep waking up and chugging along each morning. My family, my friends, beacons of light and laughter that warm my heart. You are my meaning and my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-flsT6LWwY" title="spoilers and stolen dialogue">purpose</a>, my love. </p>
            <p>In light of that, despite being incredibly uninventive, it is my continued belief that as the world is taxed and strained that the best thing I can do is continue to empower you in your lives to fight against the strains upon us all. So I ask you to treat yourselves, to enjoy the moments that life has to give, as they won't be with us forever. The shining moments are fleeting, and we must sail upon them when we get the chance to do so.</p>
            <p>So go out there, be your best you! Have a blast, and howl at the moon (or something, whatever floats your boat)</p>
