            <p>Twas the night before christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. And while I'm actually sure what a Sugar Plum is, I have been assured by elvish lawyers that they were at one time a cherished part of this holiiday.</p>
            <p>But much as time itself is never silent or still for long so too do traditions, people, and things change. My hope for all of you is that regardless of the hardships that have affected you all over the past year that you have come out the other side filling some degree of positive change</p>
            <p>It can be hard at times to remember all our accomplishments in a society that's so intent on reminding us about all that we haven't accomplished but I have seen so much from so many of you. Those who have come to accept themselves more then the year before, those that have accomplished more in their jobs or professional careeers. New relationships and new beginnings.</p>
            <p>There's a new day in front of us all, and we need only hang on and keep on chugging! You guys have got this, and I'll be right there beside you!</p>
