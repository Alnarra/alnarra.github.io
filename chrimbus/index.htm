            <p>Well well well, it’s that time of year again isn’t it? That’s ok though we’re all here and we’re all gathered round the warm glow of the internet machine sending messages, gifts, and more!</p>
<p>I am well aware that this year more so than many in the past has proved… challenging on the best of days to navigate the waves of well… everything. And So, I offer a tiny reprieve in the storm. Remember to try and treat yourself where you can. We only get to life once, and we never know where it’s going to take us, so you have to enjoy at least a little something about each day.</p>
<p>I don’t have much in the way of wisdom on how the manage the next little while, but I do know that ritual and connection are important things for humans, and we should take them where we can get them.</p> 
<p>Grab a little water, take a little nap, watch your favorite movie, or enjoy your favorite snack. Christmas comes and goes each year, but the memories we make are the things that matter, because the world we know is composed of people, not dates on a calendar, so be sure to celebrate the thing that matters, friends, family found and otherwise, and those you care for.</p>  
<p>Much love! Hope to see you all again in a years time! In the mean time have a chirping cat (Done by MonsterCheetah)!</p>
